Doing a side-project for a student in Malmö Tandvårdhögskolan. 
A program that calculates your Caries risks. Mimic:ing an existing program called Cariogram, but the formulas are not correct.. So a work in progress..

But to visit the project: https://hdfredl.github.io/cariogram/

And soon the project will have a database and work with C# as the backend for data handling etc. 


To run the program on your pc / type in following in your terminal:
1. git clone <repository_url>
2. cd <project_name/folder_name>
3. npm run dev

Make sure you got the latest version from nodejs.org.
